<p>W3C announced today <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/digital-marketing-workshop.html">Web and Digital Marketing Convergence, a W3C Workshop</a>, 17-18 September 2015, in Tampa, Florida (USA). The event is hosted by Nielsen.</p> <p>Digital Marketing and the ecosystem surrounding it are growing at an unprecedented pace as consumers and companies take advantage of new devices, features, and content on the Web. As the Open Web Platform and technologies such as HTML5 continue to expand and offer new functionalities, brands, interactive marketers, content publishers and third party providers are calling W3C&#8217;s attention to gaps and challenges, which include a lack of standards on the definition and secure execution of, for example, marketing campaigns, advertising performance, data collection, and marketing signals.</p> <p>Our goal is to start conversations with technical representatives from the broad digital marketing industry and the open web community to better understand what changes to the Open Web Platform would help improve interoperability, increase efficiencies, enable new innovations, and enhance communications. W3C membership is not required to participate. The event is open to all. All participants are required to submit a position paper by <strong>14 August 2015</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://www.w3.org/analytics/piwik/piwik.php?idsite=7&amp;rec=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Farchives%2F4784%3Fpk_campaign%3Dfeed%26pk_kwd%3Dweb-and-digital-marketing-convergence-a-w3c-workshop&amp;action_name=Web+and+Digital+Marketing+Convergence%2C+a+W3C+Workshop&amp;urlref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Ffeed" style="border:0;width:0;height:0" width="0" height="0" alt="" /></p>

Potential consumers will be able to assess whether or not the data is fit for a specific purpose and, if so, they may choose to describe their usage. This might be by means of feedback, citation, or through discovery metadata of their own.</p> <p>The working group is keen to receive feedback on all three documents both in terms of the specifics and the overall direction being taken.
